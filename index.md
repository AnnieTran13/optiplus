# Research

## Current Market
Many super apps exist on the market already but they aren’t highly focused on creating a healthy lifestyle or promoting healthy screen habits. One of them being WeChat.

### WeChat
WeChat is a very successful Chinese multi-purpose super app with over 1 billion monthly active users. It is mainly used for messaging, social media and mobile payments. 
\
WeChat promotes physical activity with its feature called WeRun which, with your permission, will track the number of steps you take and notify you when you are close to your goal. They also promote friendly competition with their daily leaderboard to match up with your friends.

Unfortunately, other than step tracker, WeChat does not have any other features to promote a more active life or healthier screen habits.

### Another problem with the current market
Most popular super apps are from Asia, which means they can’t be effectively used outside of their respective countries. The Facebook company has ambitions to create a super app and has a lot of potential to become one but once again, it is not highly focused on wellbeing and promoting a healthy lifestyle.
