## What is a Super App?
A super app is an all-in-one application that houses multiple other applications. It saves space on your phone and it makes it more convenient for the user to access the needed applications.

## Understanding the problem
Ever since the quarantine began, screen time has increased substanstally. Our health is greatly affected by COVID-19 and its implemented restrictions, both mentally and physically. We think it is important to support a healthy lifestyle while also providing a seamless user experience. Therefore, we aim to provide a platform that delivers both magnificently. Our superapp will offer features such as physical health support and mental health support. Our physical health support include services related to nutrition, fitness, sleep, screen time and more. Our mental health support includes services such mood improvement activities, habit tracker, online therapy and more.

# Research

## Current Market
Many super apps exist on the market already but they aren’t highly focused on creating a healthy lifestyle or promoting healthy screen habits. One of them being WeChat.

### WeChat
WeChat is a very successful Chinese multi-purpose super app with over 1 billion monthly active users. It is mainly used for messaging, social media and mobile payments. 
\
WeChat promotes physical activity with its feature called WeRun which, with your permission, will track the number of steps you take and notify you when you are close to your goal. They also promote friendly competition with their daily leaderboard to match up with your friends.

Unfortunately, other than step tracker, WeChat does not have any other features to promote a more active life or healthier screen habits.

### Another problem with the current market
Most popular super apps are from Asia, which means they can’t be effectively used outside of their respective countries. The Facebook company has ambitions to create a super app and has a lot of potential to become one but once again, it is not highly focused on wellbeing and promoting a healthy lifestyle.

## Surveys
These charts were created using numerous surveys to gage how people were dealing with the pandemic on a mental and a physical level.

# Design Process

### Sketches
Since a super app is composed of multiple apps, we wanted to clearly define each feature and categorize them into either physical health or mental health. We came up with an octopus as a logo because the name OptiPlus+ ressemblance to it. In addition to that, an octupus has multiple arms just like how a super app has multiple apps. This is the sketch we came up with after brainstorming.

### Wireframes
After sketching, we started creating a wireframe on Figma which also became the mockup for our app.

# Visual Design

### Color Palette
For the color palette of the main page and logo, we went with a beautiful yellow to pink gradient. The color yellow signifies positivity which we like to promote in our app while the color pink represents love. Loving yourself is very important hence why we want to encourage taking care of one's self both physically and mentally.

For the main color of the background, we wanted to incorporate a more dark theme and dark neutral colors to please the eyes.

### Typography
We used Figma's Open Sans which is a humanist, sans-serif font by Steve Matteson. It's neutral but friendly appearance is perfect for our interface.
